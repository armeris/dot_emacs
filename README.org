* My dot files

This repo is where I keep my dot files for easy bootstrapping my development environment. It is heavily geared towards Elixir development.

It uses:

- ~use-package~ for package management
- ~lsp-mode~ for my main programming mode (elixir through trevoke/alchemist.el)
- ~treemacs~ for navigating projects
- ~magit~ for magical git
- ... and some other nicities
