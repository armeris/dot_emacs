* My dot files

This repo is where I keep my dot files for easy bootstrapping my development environment. It is heavily geared towards Elixir development.

It is currently aiming Emacs 29+. It uses built-in ~use-package~, ~eglot~, ~tree-sitter~ and so on.

For initial setup, there are some things that might still need to be installed/run. Some of them are described in comments but not all of them =/

Intended for personal use! No guarantees are given here whatsoever!
